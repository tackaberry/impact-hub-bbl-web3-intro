## Historically computing power was a scarce resource (>10yrs ago)

- raise money, buy servers, manage depreciation
- treat as a capital expense (CAPEX) - big upfront üí∞üí∞üí∞
- manage resources closely
- resulting barriers to access

</Layout>

---

<Layout color={BLACK}>

## Shifting from scarcity ‚û° abundance

- on-demand pricing
- operating expense (OPEX) - no upfront, constant monthly
- lower barriers to access
- easy to monitor and manage costs

</Layout>

# What does that mean for us?

- software as a service - freemium, pay monthly
- new small ideas/businesses starting
- safe experiements, learn quickly
- features + platform + scale
- easy access, on-demand
- opportunity is abundant \*

<Footnote>

_ \* limited availability outside of developed economies _ üòê

# Trapped Value

- limited use of technology able to transform business models
- business opportunities are wasted
- only using technology for efficiency gains

---

# Releasing trapped value

- partnerships and cooperation - enterprise, community, industry, government,
- underused assets - companies, consumers
- education for tech & data skills
