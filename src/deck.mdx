# Blockchain

blockchain is a shared, distributed database that stores data in blocks that are ultimately linked together using cryptography, making verification easy and transparent

blockchain is like the operating system - need apps

no one owns the blockchain

while it may seem early days, the foundation is solid - the rules, protocols, governance - everyone knows the rules and open to anyone
